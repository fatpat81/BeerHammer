title: Wargear AST Compiler
description: How packages/rules-engine-11e/src/wargear-parser.ts compiles natural-language Wahapedia wargear prose into WargearRuleAST nodes, the five regex line patterns and helper semantics, and where the resulting ASTs live (transient UI state in RosterBuilder, never the conditionTree JSON column).

`packages/rules-engine-11e/src/wargear-parser.ts` (labelled §7.1 in the source header) is the
repository's only natural-language compiler: it turns the free prose a datasheet carries as
Wahapedia text — plain lines or raw HTML — into [`WargearRuleAST`](../../packages/types/src/index.ts#L128-L145)
nodes. It is a pure, single-pass, **line-oriented regex matcher**, not a grammar: one line of prose
in, at most one AST node out, and the whole rule model is whatever the five regexes happen to
capture. See [Rules Engine Overview](rules-engine-overview.md) for where this module sits among the
package's four, and [Data Model & Migrations](../data/data-model-and-migrations.md) for the catalog
tables the prose comes from.

## Entry point and input normalisation

`compileWahapediaWargear(rawTextOrHtml: string): WargearRuleAST[]` is exported from the package
barrel ([`src/index.ts`](../../packages/rules-engine-11e/src/index.ts#L2-L7)) and takes a single
string — no datasheet, no points table, no configuration. Its input is `CatalogUnit.wargearRulesRaw`,
which `RosterBuilder` builds by joining the `rawText` of every `wargearRules` row returned by
`GET /api/datasheets` with `\n`
([`RosterBuilder.tsx`](../../apps/web/src/components/RosterBuilder.tsx#L164-L186);
the rows come from `include: { wargearRules: true }` in
[`datasheets.ts`](../../apps/api/src/routes/datasheets.ts#L24-L38)), falling back to hard-coded demo
prose when the API returns nothing.

Before any matching happens the input is normalised
([`wargear-parser.ts#L74-L86`](../../packages/rules-engine-11e/src/wargear-parser.ts#L74-L86)):

1. `<br>` and `</li>` become newlines; `<li ...>` becomes the literal bullet `• `;
2. every remaining tag is removed with `<[^>]+>` — attributes, entities and nested markup are simply
   deleted, so text inside a `<span>` is concatenated with its neighbours on the same line;
3. the result is split on `\n`, each line trimmed, blank lines dropped;
4. per line, a leading `• ` is stripped again before matching.

Each surviving line is then tried against five patterns **in a fixed order**, and the first pattern
that matches wins (`return` inside the `forEach` callback). Rule ordering is therefore semantics:
a scale-factor line is tested before the numeric-count line, and the `ADD_ON` line is tested before
both role-targeted patterns, so a line that could plausibly satisfy two shapes always compiles to
the earlier one.

## The five recognised line patterns

| # | Pattern | Regex anchor | `ruleType` | `scope` | `constraint.maxSelections` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | scale-factor replacement — "For every 5 models in this unit, 1 model can replace its boltgun with 1 Heavy Bolter" | `/(?:for every\|for each)\s+(\d+)\s+models.*?can\s+replace\s+(.*?)\s+with\s+(.*)/i` | `REPLACE` | `TROOPER`, `scaleFactor`, `modelLimit: 1` | the **string** `floor(unit.modelCount / N)` |
| 2 | add-on — "Any model can be equipped with 1 Combat Knife" | `/(?:any\|all\|each)\s+(?:model\|models?).*?(?:can\s+be\s+equipped\|may\s+take\|can\s+take)\s+(?:with\s+)?(.*)/i` | `ADD_ON` | `ANY`, `modelLimit: 'ALL'`, no `replaces` | `'ALL'` |
| 3 | numeric model count — "2 models can replace their boltgun with 1 Meltagun" | `/^(\d+)\s+models?\s+can\s+replace\s+(?:their\s+)?(.*?)\s+with\s+(.*)/i` | `REPLACE` | `TROOPER`, `modelLimit: N` | `N` (number) |
| 4 | role-targeted, passive — "The Sergeant's boltgun can be replaced with 1 Plasma Pistol" | `/^(?:the\s+)?([A-Za-z\s]+?)(?:'s)?\s+(.*?)\s+can\s+be\s+replaced\s+with\s+(.*)/i` | `REPLACE` | sniffed role + `rawRoleName`, `modelLimit: 1` | `1` |
| 5 | role-targeted, active — "The Champion can replace his bolt pistol with 1 Plasma Pistol" | `/^(?:the\s+)?([A-Za-z\s]+?)\s+can\s+replace\s+(?:their\|his\|her\|its)?\s*(.*?)\s+with\s+(.*)/i` | `REPLACE` | sniffed role + `rawRoleName`, `modelLimit: 1` | `1` |

Every pattern records the untouched original line as `rawText` (bullet and all), so the AST keeps a
pointer back to the prose it was inferred from. All regexes are case-insensitive and every capture
group is fed to the same three helpers, which is what makes the module small — and brittle.

*One prose line through HTML stripping, the ordered pattern chain, and the helper calls that build an AST node.*

## Helper semantics

- **`slugify(text)`** prefixes `wep_`, lowercases, collapses every non-alphanumeric run to `_`, and
  trims edge underscores: `Master-crafted Power Weapon` → `wep_master_crafted_power_weapon`. The
  slug becomes each option's `id`, so two option names differing only in punctuation collide.
- **`parseCountAndName(itemStr)`** trims, strips a leading `• `, and matches `^(\d+)\s+(.*)`; with no
  leading integer it returns `{ count: 1, name: <whole string> }`. It never singularises, so
  `"2 Storm Bolters"` keeps the plural name.
- **`parseOptionList(raw)`** first rewrites ` or ` / ` and/or ` into `, ` (case-insensitive), splits
  on commas, trims, drops empties **and any fragment starting with `1 of the following`**, then maps
  each fragment through `parseCountAndName` + `slugify`. It hard-codes `pointsDelta: 0` for every
  option. Plain ` and ` is *not* a separator, so the second line of the Terminator-squad fixture —
  `… with 1 Assault Cannon and 1 Power Fist or 1 Heavy Flamer and 1 Chainfist`
  ([`RosterBuilder.tsx#L60`](../../apps/web/src/components/RosterBuilder.tsx#L60-L60)) — yields two
  options named `Assault Cannon and 1 Power Fist` and `Heavy Flamer and 1 Chainfist` rather than
  four paired alternatives.
- **`detectTargetRole(roleName)`** is keyword sniffing over the captured subject noun, not a lookup:
  `sergeant|champion|leader|captain|aspiring` → `SERGEANT`, `chassis|hull|body` → `CHASSIS`,
  anything else → `TROOPER`. The unedited capture is still stored as `scope.rawRoleName`, which is
  what the UI prints. Because the subject group is lazy and `([A-Za-z\s]+?)` accepts spaces, the
  split lands on the *first* plausible whitespace: `The Sergeant's storm bolter can be replaced with
  1 Combi-weapon` yields `rawRoleName: 'Sergeant'` / `replaces: 'storm bolter'` (the `'s` is absorbed
  by the optional `(?:'s)?`), while `The Heavy Flamer can be replaced with 1 Onslaught Gatling
  Cannon` — a weapon, not a role — yields `rawRoleName: 'Heavy'` and a `replaces` name of just
  `Flamer`, scoped `TROOPER`.
- **`inferConsumedSlots(optionNames)`** scans option names against two keyword lists —
  `bolter|cannon|flamer|rifle|pistol|melta|plasma|las` for ranged and
  `sword|fist|hammer|axe|claw|blade|knife|maul` for melee — returning `['primary_ranged','melee']`
  when both hit, `['melee']` for melee only, and `['primary_ranged']` otherwise (including for an
  empty option list). Despite `ConsumedSlot` admitting `secondary_ranged` and `chassis_addon`
  ([`types/src/index.ts#L119`](../../packages/types/src/index.ts#L119-L119)), the compiler can only
  ever emit the other two — and nothing downstream reads the field at all.

## Invariants an editor must preserve

Three generated properties are load-bearing for consumers and are not enforced by types or tests:

- **`id` is `rule_gen_<Date.now()>_<lineIndex>`.** Structure is deterministic; identity is not.
  Recompiling the same text yields new ids, so any `wargearSelections` entry keyed by `ruleId` is
  invalidated by the next recompile. `RosterBuilder` already works around this by keying rule cards
  on `rule.id + '-' + idx` instead of the id alone
  ([`RosterBuilder.tsx#L623-L625`](../../apps/web/src/components/RosterBuilder.tsx#L623-L625)).
- **`pointsDelta` is always `0`.** Pricing is never derived from prose, which makes the "+Npts" badge
  in `WargearRuleCard` unreachable in practice and leaves `RosterUnit.pointsCost` pinned to
  `catalogUnit.basePoints` regardless of what is selected.
- **Unmatched lines are dropped silently.** There is no error, warning, log, or "unknown" node type;
  a line that matches none of the five patterns simply produces no AST entry, and fully unrecognised
  input compiles to `[]` (asserted by
  [`wargear-parser.test.ts#L108-L111`](../../packages/rules-engine-11e/src/__tests__/wargear-parser.test.ts#L108-L111)).
  The UI cannot distinguish "this unit has no options" from "this unit's options failed to parse" —
  both render as *No configurable wargear options for this unit*.

## Failure modes visible in the repository's own prose

The demo/fallback corpus in the web app already contains lines the compiler mishandles, which is the
clearest statement of the pattern set's reach:

| Line | Where | What the compiler does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `For every 5 models, 1 model can replace with 1 Assault Cannon and 1 Power Fist` | [`catalog/page.tsx#L39`](../../apps/web/src/app/catalog/page.tsx#L39-L39) | **dropped.** Pattern 1 needs `replace <X> with <Y>` with a non-empty `<X>`, but here the single ` with ` follows `replace` immediately, so `(.*?)\s+with\s+` can never settle; patterns 3–5 cannot match the `For every …` prefix either. |
| `All models can replace 2 Assault Bolters with 2 Plasma Exterminators` | [`catalog/page.tsx#L99`](../../apps/web/src/app/catalog/page.tsx#L99-L99) | matches pattern 5 with subject `All models` → scoped `TROOPER` with `modelLimit: 1` and `maxSelections: 1`, losing the "all models" quantity. |
| `Any model can be equipped with 1 Multi-melta instead of 1 Melta Rifle` | [`RosterBuilder.tsx#L104`](../../apps/web/src/components/RosterBuilder.tsx#L104-L104) | matches pattern 2, but `instead of` is not a grammar the parser knows: the option name becomes `Multi-melta instead of 1 Melta Rifle` and `replaces` stays `undefined`. |
| `Can be equipped with 1 Storm Bolter, 1 Multi-melta, and 1 Hunter-killer Missile` | [`catalog/page.tsx#L111`](../../apps/web/src/app/catalog/page.tsx#L111-L111) | **dropped.** Pattern 2 requires an `any`/`all`/`each` + `model` subject, and no other pattern admits `can be equipped`. |

The general rule for anyone touching the parser: widen a pattern or add a new one *before* the
existing ones only if you have checked that no currently-matching corpus line is stolen by it, and
add the offending corpus line as a test — there is no diagnostic that would otherwise tell you a
datasheet's prose stopped compiling.

## Where the ASTs land

The compiler has exactly one production caller, and the AST never leaves the browser.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  W["Wahapedia prose"] --> T["wargear_rules_11e.raw_text"]
  T -->|"include wargearRules"| API["GET /api/datasheets"]
  API --> RAW["CatalogUnit.wargearRulesRaw"]
  RAW -->|"useMemo per expanded unit"| C["compileWahapediaWargear"]
  C --> CARD["WargearRuleCard selection state"]
  CARD -.->|"never written back"| SEL["RosterUnit.wargearSelections always empty"]
  T -.->|"column exists, no reader or writer"| CT["wargear_rules_11e.condition_tree JSON"]
```

*Prose travels from Postgres `raw_text` to a freshly compiled AST at render time; the `conditionTree` JSON column is a dead end.*

- `RosterBuilder` recompiles on demand inside a `useMemo` keyed on the expanded unit instance
  ([`RosterBuilder.tsx#L272-L278`](../../apps/web/src/components/RosterBuilder.tsx#L272-L278));
  the result is render-only, one `WargearRuleCard` per node.
- `WargearRuleCard` keeps the chosen option in **local `useState`**
  ([`RosterBuilder.tsx#L657-L726`](../../apps/web/src/components/RosterBuilder.tsx#L657-L726)) and
  never calls back into the roster. `RosterUnit.wargearSelections` is initialised to `[]` when a unit
  is added and mutated nowhere, so the "client-side selection validation" the file header promises is
  a toggle highlight: `maxSelections` is displayed (numbers verbatim, anything else as `∞`, which is
  how both `'ALL'` and the scale-factor string `floor(unit.modelCount / N)` render), and
  `consumedSlots` / `isMutuallyExclusive` are never read by any consumer in the repository. Because
  the max is only printed and never enforced, no client code evaluates the scale expression either —
  it is a display string, not a constraint language.
- Nothing persists ASTs. `WargearRule.conditionTree Json` in
  [`schema.prisma#L164-L177`](../../packages/db-client/prisma/schema.prisma#L164-L177) is *named* as
  the AST home, but no application code reads or writes it; it exists only as part of the row JSON
  serialised out by `include: { wargearRules: true }`. The live shape is therefore
  "store prose, recompile at read time", and the AST and the column can drift apart with no test
  failing. Note also that `prisma/seed.ts` inserts no `wargear_rules_11e` rows, so against a freshly
  seeded database the live path yields an empty rule list and the demo prose takes over.
- The two selection shapes in the codebase disagree: `@forceorg/types` declares
  `WargearSelection { ruleId, selectedOptionId, count }`
  ([`types/src/index.ts#L177-L181`](../../packages/types/src/index.ts#L177-L181)) while
  `RosterBuilder`'s local `RosterUnit` uses `{ ruleId, optionId, count }`. Anything that eventually
  wires selections to persistence must pick one deliberately rather than casting between them.

## Test guardrails

[`__tests__/wargear-parser.test.ts`](../../packages/rules-engine-11e/src/__tests__/wargear-parser.test.ts)
(14 vitest cases, part of the suite the CI coverage gate runs — see
[CI/CD Pipelines](../operations/ci-cd-pipelines.md)) pins `slugify` output shape,
`parseCountAndName` count-defaulting and bullet stripping, `parseOptionList` comma/`or` splitting
with `1 of the following` filtering, each of the five prose patterns, multi-`<li>` HTML input, and
the empty-array case for unrecognised text. It asserts nothing about `consumedSlots` inference,
`pointsDelta`, or `rule_gen_` id instability, and the mis-parsing cases above are untested — so
those behaviours can change silently, while any change to the five patterns' captured
`scope`/`replaces`/`options`/`maxSelections` values will fail loudly.
